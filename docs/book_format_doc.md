# Book format

The book is written in Jupyter notebook, texts are in the markdown cells, and codes are in the code cells.

# Naming of the notebooks

Let's have consistent naming for all the notebooks. 

The notebook name should follow the following format

```
 ChapterXX.YY-Name-of-The-Chapter.ipynb
```
Where XX start with 01, and YY start with 01. 

# Inside of the notebooks

Each notebook should start with a markdown cell with the title of this section, starting with the first level header (this is, just one #). The first notebook for each chapter should start "Chapter X Name of the Content". For the rest of the chapter, it should start with the numerical number, for example "1 What is Machine Learning" etc. This way, the TOC on the website will look nice.
